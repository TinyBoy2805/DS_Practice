# ðŸ“˜ Data Structure Roadmap

A self-implementation journey from basic to advanced.  
Check off âœ… each structure once youâ€™ve built it.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Level 1: Basics (Array-based)
- [âœ…] Dynamic Array (like ArrayList)
- [ ] Stack (array-based)
- [ ] Queue (array-based)
- [ ] Deque (double-ended queue)

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Level 2: Linked Structures
- [ ] Singly Linked List
- [ ] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Stack (linked list)
- [ ] Queue (linked list)
- [ ] Circular Linked List

---

## ðŸŸ  Level 3: Hashing
- [ ] Hash Table (linear probing, chaining)
- [ ] Hash Set (like HashSet)
- [ ] Hash Map (like HashMap)

---

## ðŸ”µ Level 4: Trees
- [ ] Binary Tree (BT)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (BST)
- [ ] AVL Tree (self-balancing)
- [ ] Heap (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- [ ] Priority Queue (heap-based)
- [ ] Trie (Prefix Tree)

---

## ðŸŸ£ Level 5: Graphs
- [ ] Adjacency List
- [ ] Adjacency Matrix
- [ ] Algorithms:
  - [ ] BFS
  - [ ] DFS
  - [ ] Dijkstra
  - [ ] Bellman-Ford
  - [ ] Floyd-Warshall
  - [ ] Kruskal (MST)
  - [ ] Prim (MST)

---

## âš« Level 6: Advanced (Bonus)
- [ ] Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
- [ ] Segment Tree
- [ ] Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
- [ ] Red-Black Tree (hardcore, like Java TreeMap)
- [ ] B-Tree / B+Tree (commonly used in databases)

---

âœ¨ Once completed, youâ€™ll have your own **custom Data Structures library** to showcase in your CV or projects.
